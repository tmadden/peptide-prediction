PACE
====

Welcome to PACE, a framework for comparing machine learning algorithms for the
peptide-MHC binding problem. While many potential solutions to this problem have
been published, a shared dataset and evaluation protocol have been missing,
making it impossible to compare the various approaches. PACE (peptide algorithm
comparison environment) fills that void by supplying a 16 HLA allele dataset and
a structured evaluation protocol such that algorithms can be fairly compared.

As a secondary goal, PACE aims to provide useful utilities to facilitate the
development of prediction algorithms, such as characteristics for alleles,
utilities for implementing algorithms on common machine learning frameworks,
etc.
