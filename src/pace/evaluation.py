    Score a set of predictions by ranking them and determining what fraction of

    Parameters
    ----------
    truth
        an array of numbers indicating the true binding scores - All entries are
        either 0 or 1.

    predictions
        an array of numbers indicating the predicted binding scores - All
        entries are between 0 and 1.

    top_n
        the number of 'top' predictions to consider in the score (e.g., If this
        is 20, then we only care that the algorithm's top 20 predictions are
        actually binders.) - This should be no larger than the number of true

    Evaluate an algorithm.

    Given a dataset and an algorithm, this evaluates the algorithm by repeatedly
    splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, training a new
    algorithm instance, asking it to make predictions about the testing subset,
    and scoring those predictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    algorithm_class : pace.PredictionAlgorithm
        a function taking no arguments that returns a new instance of the
        algorithm to test - If the algorithm class has a default constructor,
        you can simply pass in the class itself. Otherwise, pass in a lambda
        that fills in the constructor arguments appropriately. The algorithm
        must implement the interface specified by
        :class:`pace.PredictionAlgorithm`.

    dataset : pace.Dataset
        the dataset to use for testing - If omitted, the builtin dataset is
        used. The dataset must implement the interface specified by
        :class:`pace.Dataset`.

    folds : int
        the number of folds (i.e., iterations) to perform (default is 5)

    selected_alleles : List[str], optional
        a list of alleles to use for training - If a value is given here, the
        dataset is filtered so that only samples for those alleles are used for
        training. (By default, no filtering is done.) Note that this will also
        determine the filtering of the test data unless a different filter is
        explicitly specified.

    selected_lengths : List[int], optional
        a list of peptide lengths to use for training - If a value is given
        here, the dataset is filtered so that only samples for those lengths
        are used for training. (By default, no filtering is done.) Note that
        this will also determine the filtering of the test data unless a
        different filter is explicitly specified.

    nbr_train : float, optional
        the nonbinder ratio for training - This determines the ratio of
        nonbinders to binders in the set of samples used for training the
        algorithm. It defaults to 1.

    test_alleles : List[str], optional
        a list of alleles to use for testing - This is equivalent to
        ``selected_allles`` but determines the filtering for the testing phase.
        By default, the same set that was used for training is also used for
        testing.

    test_lengths : List[int], optional
        a list of peptide lengths to use for testing - This is equivalent to
        ``selected_lengths`` but determines the filtering for the testing phase.
        By default, the same set that was used for training is also used for
        testing.

    nbr_test
        the nonbinder ratio for testing - This determines the ratio of
        nonbinders to binders in the set of samples used for testing the
        algorithm. It defaults to 10. (Using a value much higher than 10 with
        the default dataset (without subselecting) will exhaust the pool of
        nonbinders.)

    scorers : Dict[str,pace.Scorer]
        a map from labels to scorers - If omitted,
        ``pace.evaluation.default_scorers`` is used.

    Returns
    -------
